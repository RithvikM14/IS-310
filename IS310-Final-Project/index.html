<h1>Cultural Analysis of IPL 2021 Through Twitter Data</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> The Indian Premier League (IPL) is not just a cricketing event; it's a cultural phenomenon that captivates millions around the globe. In this project, we set out to explore the cultural conversations surrounding IPL 2021 by analyzing Twitter data. Our goal is to uncover patterns and sentiments that reflect the event's impact on the public and how technology mediates the discourse around it.

    The IPL coincides with a significant presence on social media, especially on platforms like Twitter where fans, teams, and pundits share their thoughts and feelings. As such, IPL-related tweets offer a rich dataset to examine the cultural aspects of this sporting event. We aim to see how the discussions evolved over the season, the geographical diversity of IPL's audience, and the overall sentiment attached to the event.
    
    During the project, pivots were necessary to accommodate the challenges posed by data collection and to align with the objectives of the course, which focuses on cultural data and its computational analysis. For instance, we refined our data collection methods to capture a more accurate representation of the global IPL discourse.

<h2>Data Collection & Curation</h2>
<p> To harness the breadth of discussions, we gathered tweets using the hashtag #ipl2021 during the tournament season. The data collection involved using Twitter's API to fetch relevant tweets and metadata, followed by a curation process that ensured data quality and relevance.

    Here's how the data collection and curation unfolded:
    
    Utilized Twitter API v2 to fetch tweets containing #ipl2021.
    Implemented data cleaning techniques to process and standardize user locations for geographical analysis.
    Applied named entity recognition to extract mentions of players, teams, and other IPL-related keywords.
    A snippet of the collected data, alongside the Python code used for scraping, is provided to demonstrate the methodology. Additionally, the dataset's structure is explained, highlighting any revisions made to improve data quality.
