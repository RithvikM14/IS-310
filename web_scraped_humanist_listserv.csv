«[T]ruth is not born nor is it to be found inside the head of an individual person, it is born between people collectively searching for the truth, in the process of their dialogic interaction.... » Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, trans. Caryl Emerson (University of Minnesota Press, 1984, pp. 110.


""We"" philosophers are... distinguished ... by our ability to engage in continuous conversation, testing one another, discovering our hidden presuppositions, changing our minds because we have listened to the voices of our fellows. Lunatics also change their minds, but their minds change with the tides of the moon and not because they have listened, really listened, to their friends' questions and objections. Montaigne in his tower and Kierkegaard in his isolation are of that goodly listening company, despite their solitude. The inner voices that they heard were real enough, Montaigne remembering his friend Etienne de la Boetie, and Kierkegaard mocking Pastor Adler. Amelie Oksenberg Rorty, Experiments in Philosophic Genre: Descartes' ""Meditations"", Critical Inquiry 9.3 (1983): 562.
